# SOC Automation Project

## Project Overview
This project is centered around automating security operations center (SOC) workflows using **Shuffle SOAR** for orchestration and automation. The goal is to automate repetitive SOC tasks, such as alert triage, incident response, and case management, to improve efficiency and speed in handling security events.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- **Shuffle SOAR** – Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform.
- **TheHive** – Case management for incident tracking.
- **Wazuh** – SIEM platform for log analysis and event detection.

## Features
- Automated incident triage and alert escalation using **Shuffle SOAR**.
- Integrated **Wazuh** alerts with **TheHive** for centralized case management.
- Streamlined incident response process for faster remediation.

## Project Walkthrough
1. **Setup**:
   - Configured **Shuffle SOAR** for automation workflows, connecting it with **Wazuh** and **TheHive**.
   - Created automated playbooks for handling common incidents (e.g., malware alerts, unauthorized access).
2. **Automation**:
   - Integrated **Wazuh** alerts with **Shuffle SOAR** to trigger automation when a new security event is detected.
3. **Case Management**:
   - Integrated **TheHive** with the automation workflow to manage incidents from detection to resolution.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of **SOAR** in automating the SOC workflow. By automating repetitive tasks, it significantly improves incident response times and reduces manual effort, allowing security teams to focus on high-priority threats.
